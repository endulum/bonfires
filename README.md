Bonfires is a messaging app with a toasty, cozy flavor.

- Upload custom user and camp avatars
- Customize user display name, name color, and activity invisibility both as broad default and per camp
- Camps have activity indicators that show which users are viewing the camp and typing a message
- Toggleable light and dark mode, with preference remembered

### Tech rundown

### Installation

This is a Node.js project, so you will need Node installed.

This repo hosts a frontend that interacts with the [Bonfires API](https://github.com/endulum/bonfires-api). It will need to be installed and running on a port.

Navigate to the root directory where you'd like this project to be, and clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/endulum/bonfires
```

Navigate to the root of the newly created `/bonfires`, and install all required packages:

```sh
npm install
```

### Integrations and environment

This project uses two env files: `development` and `production`. This project supplies a file `.env.example` with the variables necessary to run; copy this file to the two envs specified.

```sh
cp -n .env.example .env.development && cp -n .env.example .env.production
```

This frontend uses very few variables:

- `VITE_APP_NAME`: A string representing the name of this app, set to `Bonfires` by default.
- `VITE_API_URL`: You should have the [Bonfires API](https://github.com/endulum/bonfires-api) up and running somewhere; this var represents the API's URL.
- `VITE_GH_CLIENT_ID`: If you've connected a GitHub App to the Bonfires API, you should add its client ID here, too.
